I’m Aakash Madhav Rao, an aspiring PhD student with a strong background in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Currently pursuing an MSc in AI and Machine Learning at the University of Birmingham, my research focuses on applying machine learning techniques to healthcare and neuroethology. I have developed high-precision models and contributed to projects exploring the potential of AI in scientific discovery.

In previous roles, I've led research teams, presented findings at international conferences, and co-authored manuscripts in machine learning and medical imaging. I’m passionate about advancing AI’s role in improving patient outcomes and understanding complex biological systems, and I am excited to explore opportunities in PhD programs starting Fall 2025.
