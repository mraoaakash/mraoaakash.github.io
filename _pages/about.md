I trained as a computer scientist at Ashoka University and have grown into an applied machine learner through a multitude of research experiences over the past five years. My love for ML and Medicine has led me down a fascinating route to building interpretable models for biomedical imaging applications. I am completing my MSc in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Birmingham, where I research interpretable generative models for breast cancer histopathology image generation. My research interests span multi-modal learning, medical computer vision, ML-aided clinical decision-making, and foundation models for biomedical applications.
