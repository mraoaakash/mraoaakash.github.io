I have been a part of the teaching team in various courses, as shown below

### Introduction to Machine Learning (TA)
**CSL-2010 at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Jodhpur** | _May 2023 - August 2023 (Summer 2023)_    
Professor: Prof. Rintu Kutum   
This is an elective requirement offered during the summer semester at IIT Jodhpur that provides students from a wide array of disciplines with the foundations of machine learning. This was small course with 30 students.
- I handle a large chunk of the grading
- I taught the lab sessions to foster practical learning of the concepts discussed in class
- I had weekly office hours to have one-on-one interractions with the students to discuss learning gaps and to improve the current lesson plans


### The New Geography of the Information Age (TA)
**CS-2379 at Ashoka University** | _January 2023 - May (Spring 2023) 2023 and January 2022 - May 2022 (Spring 2023)_    
Professor: Prof. Debayan Gupta  
This course focussed on socio-technical problems caused by humanity blindly stumbling its way into the Information Age. Our new world has new rules: intellectual property looks different, cyber-crime looms large, cold cyber-warfare persists at a nation-state level, planet-scale surveillance is commonplace, we're all about to lose our jobs to robots, and the list goes on. This was a large cohort with over 180 students.
- I handled discussion sections to have more student interaction owing to large class sizes
- I handled a chunk of the grading for essays and analytical papers


### Data Structures 1 (TA)
**CS-1203 at Ashoka University** | _August 2022 - December 2022 (Winter 2022)_  
Professor: Prof. Debayan Gupta and Prof. Soumyottam Chatterjee  
This course is a core computer science requirement that familiarises undergraduate students with the intricacies of the various data structures and their implementations in various programming languages. It aims to provide foundational knowledge on their working as well as the intuition on how they are to be used. This was a large cohort with over 100 students.  
- I handled grading an individual feedback for examinations and weekly assignments
- I handled hands on practice sessions to demonstrate use-cases of the course material and help build the intuition for programatic thinking.
- I had weekly office hours to have one-on-one interractions with the students to discuss learning gaps and to improve the current lesson plans
