### Description
We implemented an approach that used a dimensionally reduced component of a MELSpectrogram generated from the given input samples. We trained a simple neural network that learned a decision boundary between these samples. We were placed 6th in the [CODA TB Grand Challenge](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn31472953/wiki/617828) 2023.

### My Role
I adviced on the project in terms of the design of the Artificial Neural Network as well as the benchmarking of other algorithms on the dataset.
