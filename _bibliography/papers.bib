	abstract = {Oral cancer is a global health challenge with a difficult histopathological diagnosis. The accurate histopathological interpretation of oral cancer tissue samples remains difficult. However, early diagnosis is very challenging due to a lack of experienced pathologists and inter-observer variability in diagnosis. The application of artificial intelligence (deep learning algorithms) for oral cancer histology images is very promising for rapid diagnosis. However, it requires a quality annotated dataset to build AI models. We present ORCHID (ORal Cancer Histology Image Database), a specialized database generated to advance research in AI-based histology image analytics of oral cancer and precancer. The ORCHID database is an extensive multicenter collection of 300,000 image patches, encapsulating various oral cancer and precancer categories, such as oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF) and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Additionally, it also contains grade-level sub-classifications for OSCC, such as well-differentiated (WD), moderately-differentiated (MD), and poorly-differentiated (PD). Furthermore, the database seeks to bolster the creation and validation of innovative artificial intelligence-based rapid diagnostics for OSMF and OSCC, along with subtypes.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by SERB, DST, IndiaAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Tissue slides were collected with the approval of an ethical committee from the participating hospitals and research institutions, (1) Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi, (2) Maulana Azad Institute of Dental Sciences, New Delhi; (3) Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences, Jharkhand, (4) Banaras Hindu University, Banaras, and (5) All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.
