Some of the sights and wonderful experiences at Lyon and Also My conference ID, something I will hold close to my heart. The most amazing view I came across was while I walked across from the Basilica of Notre Dame of Fourvière to the Ancient Theatre. It showed me the entire Lyonnaise cityscape in one frame.
